-- A source is a feature addon's registration with the player: what it is called, how its
-- clips are admitted, and the hooks its domain-specific rules hang off. Everything a
-- single domain cares about -- gossip yielding to quest dialogue, narration held through
-- combat, a cap on how far behind narration may fall -- is expressed through one of
-- these, so the queue itself never learns what a quest or a zone is.
