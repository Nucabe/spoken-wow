/**
 * Every voice this project has: each race-gender and the flavors it is voiced in.
 *
 * This is the roster, not a view of the corpus. The voice list on /voices, the triage race,
 * gender and flavor selects, and the explorer's filters all read it, so a voice is supported
 * by adding it here -- before any line uses it, which is the only way a new race can get in:
 * a moderator cannot pick a race nobody offers, and a voice has to exist on /voices to be
 * cloned before its first line is accepted. The corpus supplies the line counts and nothing
 * else; voices.test.ts fails on a corpus line whose voice is missing here, and accepting a
 * contribution refuses one (lib/contributions/accept.ts).
 *
 * A flavor is which of a race-gender's NPC voice sets an NPC speaks with -- tts_cli/flavors.py
 * recovers it from the game's sound entry names, like OrcMaleShadyNPCGreetings. `null` is a
 * voice with no flavor, named bare `race-gender`: narrator-male, which is not a race, and a
 * race-gender whose sets are not known yet.
 *
 * Free of imports on purpose: ContributionTable.tsx is a client component and reads it.
