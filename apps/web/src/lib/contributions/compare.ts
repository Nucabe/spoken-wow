/**
 * Whether a contributed text says what a corpus line already says.
 *
 * Not string equality. The two sides are written down differently even when they are the same
 * line: the corpus keeps the game's own template (`$B` for a paragraph break, `$n` or `$N` for
 * the player's name, `$Gman:woman;` for a word that follows the player's gender), and a
 * contribution is what one player's client displayed, with the paragraph breaks as real
 * newlines, one branch of every `$G` already picked, and the player's name, class and race put
 * back as `$N`, `$C` and `$R` by the addon (addons/Spoken_Quests/Contribute.lua, Detemplate).
 *
 * That last step guesses, and guesses both ways. A paladin reading "the paladins of the
 * alliance" sends "$C" where the corpus has the plain word, and a client that missed the name
 * sends "Index" where the corpus has `$N`. Either is still the same line. So a slot -- `$N`,
 * `$C` or `$R`, on either side -- stands for any one to three words on the other (a race can be
 * two, "Night Elf"), and everything else must match word for word and mark for mark. Spacing
 * and letter case never count: the corpus carries trailing and doubled spaces the client never
 * shows, and a line recapitalised between game versions sounds the same.
 *
 * Node-free, so the corrections tab's client component can split a line the same way.
